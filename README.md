  esterify! desktop (alpha)

esterify! desktop is a Python script, that converts any supported distro with pre-installed vanilla GNOME to look like esterOS!

> [!WARNING]
> This script is in it's early stages of development and it's meant to be used ***ONLY*** on supported distros with **Vanilla GNOME**. ***DO NOT*** use this script on your personal machine, especially if the distro isn't supported! \
> Future support may be added for other DE's, but its not guaranteed! \
> Some of esterOS's signature features still havent been fully implemented, so stay tuned!
